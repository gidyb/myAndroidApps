Here is a list of the uploaded projects:

1) MedApp - My MSc in Technology & Information Systems managment final project.
            This is an app that lets you call an ambulance (methodically) and gives you medical information on how to
            help a person in need (including videos). 
            In my project, I developed several UIs for this app and tested how the personalization of UI can help users
            use the app more effectively and enjoy it more. I succeeded proving that.
            
2) CarPark - An app that lets you save your parking place.
             I'm currently working on this one
