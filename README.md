Here is a list of the uploaded projects:

1) MedApp - My MSc in Technology & Information Systems managment final research project on UI Personalization for                    stressfull events.
            
            This is an app that lets you call an ambulance (methodically) and gives you medical information on how to
            help a person in need (including instruction videos). 
            
            In my research project, I developed several UIs for this app and tested it in a series of tests (which                included human-but-not-really-hurt patients how the personalization of UI (by gender and the medical                  experience of the user) can help users use the app more effectively and enjoy it more. I succeeded proving             that personlized UIs are better than generic one.
            
            I uploaded 2 versions of the APP - the generic version and the version not experienced women (MedAppNEW)

2) CarPark - An app that lets save geographic locations and navigate to them. 
             Originaly I thought of the need to save my parking place, but developed more features to play a bit with                 Android features.
